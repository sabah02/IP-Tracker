### What I learned

In this particular project, I was familiar with API and had a little bittt.. information about them but I had never used them before so, in this project I learned
  1 `What is an API` - It's an interface which allows develpers to built apps by using data and features of other services and applications.It is basically used to use functions written by other applications and use this functions/features in your own application. In this project I used  `ipify` and `leafletjs` APIs. 
  `ipify` was used to give information like IP address, Country, City, Time zone and Internet Service Provider about a particular IP address or domain name.
  `leafletjs` was used to display map.

One more new thing I learned was, How to get user input from the input element (using .value method)
  

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about API different architectures/type of API and how to build them.
